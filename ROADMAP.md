### Refactoring or Improvement Plan

Project: document-verification-api

1. Improve error handling to be more precise.
   - Handle specific exceptions or create custom exception classes for better error handling and debugging
   - For instance, checking the value of result.
2. Add logging mechanism.
3. Update test files and refactor what's necessary to make code readable. Explore pest test more.
   - Group test cases
   - More robust unit test
   - Standardized all syntaxes across all test cases
   - Add exclusive test case for DocumentVerificationResult model
   - Add negative test cases that accept data that doesn't match instead of just feeding with incomplete or missing data
4. Add more validation, like custom validation for returned validation status.
5. Separate document verification result into its own resource controller. 
6. Add necessary and concise comments describing methods.
